# Introduction

The aim of this book is to learn the basics of x-ray transmission physics and imaging.

Radiological images, historically implemented for control of welds and castings are easily interpretable. The image is all the clearer here that the X-ray beam is attenuated. In imagery by attenuation is the very principle of radiology. We are already perceiving the limits of radiology for thick material which may block full of beam and therefore make it impossible the control.

On this developed radiography of a tire we can see the folds of the tablecloth. For civil engineering machinery, the price very large large diameter tires justify checking deepened.

X-ray tomography is widely used to inspect in three dimensions inside a room. The reconstructed volume obtained is therefore the 3D image of the attenuation coefficient for the X-rays.

X-ray imagery is therefore attenuation imagery, like a cast shadow. The image obtained presents necessarily a magnification ($M>1$), because the X optics are very delicate to set up (the beam is therefore diverge from source). Attenuation increases with the thickness $X$ of the part, with the density $\rho$ and the atomic number $Z$ of the material. We can also note that the spatial resolution will be essentially conditioned by the detector and / or the experimental protocol, and not by the wavelength which is very much lower than the micron.
